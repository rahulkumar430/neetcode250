Extra Characters in a String

Difficulty Level : MEDIUM

You are given a string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.

Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times.

Example 1:

Input: s = "neetcodes", dictionary = ["neet","code","neetcode"]

Output: 1
Explanation: The optimal way is to break s into two substrings: "neet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 4 to 7. There is one character which is at index 8.

Example 2:

Input: s = "neetcodde", dictionary = ["neet","code","neetcode"]

Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal way is to break s into one substring: "neet" from index 0 to 3. The characters at indices from 4 to 8 are extra.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50
s and dictionary[i] consist of only lowercase English letters
dictionary contains distinct words
