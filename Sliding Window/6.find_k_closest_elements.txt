Find K Closest Elements

Difficulty Level : MEDIUM

You are given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:

|a - x| < |b - x|, or
|a - x| == |b - x| and a < b
Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,4,5,8], k = 2, x = 6

Output: [4,5]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,3,4], k = 3, x = 1

Output: [2,3,4]
Constraints:

1 <= k <= arr.length <= 10,000.
-10,000 <= arr[i], x <= 10,000
arr is sorted in ascending order.
