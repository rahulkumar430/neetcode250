Majority Element II

Difficulty Level : MEDIUM

You are given an integer array nums of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times. You can return the result in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,3,2,2,2,2,5,5,5]

Output: [2,5]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,4,4,4,4]

Output: [4]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: []
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50,000.
-1,000,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 1,000,000,000
Follow up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
