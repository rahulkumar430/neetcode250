Sort an Array

Difficulty Level : MEDIUM

You are given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,9,1,1,1,2,3,1]

Output: [1,1,1,1,2,3,9,10]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,10,2,1,3]

Output: [1,2,3,5,10]
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50,000.
-50,000 <= nums[i] <= 50,000
