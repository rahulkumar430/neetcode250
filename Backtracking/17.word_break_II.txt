Word Break II

Difficulty Level : HARD

You are given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:

Input: s = "neetcode", wordDict = ["neet","code"]

Output: ["neet code"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "racecariscar", wordDict = ["racecar","race","car","is"]

Output: ["racecar is car","race car is car"]
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsincars", wordDict = ["cats","cat","sin","in","car"]

Output: []
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20
1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10
s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of wordDict are unique.
Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 100,000.
