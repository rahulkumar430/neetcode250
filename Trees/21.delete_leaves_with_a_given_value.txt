Delete Leaves With a Given Value

Difficulty Level : MEDIUM

You are given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

Input: root = [1,2,3,5,2,2,5], target = 2

Output: [1,2,3,5,null,null,5]

Input: root = [3,null,3,3], target = 3

Output: []
Explanation: The output is an empty tree after removing all the nodes with value 3.

Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 3000
1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000
