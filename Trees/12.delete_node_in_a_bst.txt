Delete Node in a BST

Difficulty Level : MEDIUM

You are given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST, if present. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: There can be multiple results after deleting the node, return any one of them.

Input: root = [5,3,9,1,4], key = 3

Output: [5,4,9,1]

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,null,4,null,10,null,null,7], key = 3

Output: [5,4,6,null,null,null,10,7]
Constraints:

0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 10,000.
-100,000 <= key, Node.val <= 100,000
All the values Node.val are unique.
